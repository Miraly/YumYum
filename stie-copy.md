### The only thing certain in these times is that we live in times of uncertainty.


We know the true value of community. In the best of times, a strong community
drives new innovation and economic development. In the worst of times, community
can suffer because of fear, misinformation, and uncertainty. If we loose trust in our neighbors, we
become weaker not stronger.

Our platform, <insert good name here>, aims to close that divide by providing a place
for people to regain trust in our neighbors through the cultural ritual of food.
It is through this necessity of sustenance we can break down the walls between us.

Our platform provides access to a market place between members of local communities
but also education about the traditions and culture of our neighbors through home cooked meals;
Meals made fresh with love and care made by real people and perfected over generations
and not machines made in mass.
